# Solvable Market Hypothesis

This repository contains the initial draft of the "Solvable Market Hypothesis: Toward a Mathematical Theory of Market Predictability through Collective Behavior and Game Theory."

The hypothesis proposes that market movements can theoretically be predicted through integration of collective behavior, game theory, and mathematical modeling â€” likening the financial market to a complex, but solvable, game such as chess.
